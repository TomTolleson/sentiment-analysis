## Features
- Pre-trained models for quick deployment.
- Fine-tuning capabilities on custom datasets.
- Easy integration with Hugging Face Hub for model sharing.
- Real-time inference through a FastAPI interface.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the model for sentiment analysis as follows:

```python
from sentiment_model import SentimentAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.predict("I love using this model!")
print(result)  # Output: Positive
```

## API Usage

To create a FastAPI application for sentiment analysis, you can use the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from src.inference import SentimentAnalyzer

app = FastAPI()
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()

@app.post("/analyze")
async def analyze_text(text: str):
    return analyzer.predict(text)
```

## Training

To train the model on your own dataset, prepare your data in the required format and run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --data_path path/to/your/data.csv --model_name your_model_name
```

## Evaluation

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/your/model
```
